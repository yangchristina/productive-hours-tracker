# My Personal Project

## Energy level tracker

*What will the application do?*

The application will allow the user to log their energy levels every hour,
and display their peak energy periods and the time when the user's energy levels are at their lowest.

*Who will use it?*

People who want to track their energy levels to better plan out when to do which type of tasks.
For example, a person might want to know when they are at their peak energy levels
so that they spend this period doing more analytical tasks. Conversely, they may want to put routiine tasks, 
such as checking emails into time when energy levels are the lowest. 

*Why is this project of interest to you?*

This projects interests me as i read the book ___, and learned the benefits of timing.
