# My Personal Project

## Energy level tracker

*What will the application do?*

The application will allow the user to log their energy levels every hour,
and display their peak energy periods and the time when the user's energy levels are at their lowest.

*Who will use it?*

People who want to track their energy levels to better plan out when to do which type of tasks.
For example, a person might want to know when they are at their peak energy levels
so that they spend this period doing more analytical tasks. Conversely, they may want to put routiine tasks, 
such as checking emails into time when energy levels are the lowest. 

*Why is this project of interest to you?*

This projects interests me as i read the book *When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing* by Daniel H. Pink, and learned the benefits of timing.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to log energy level for a certain time of day
- As a user, I want to be able to quickly log my energy level for my current time of day
- As a user, I want to be able to view my past logs, ordered by date of energy log
- As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete my past energy entry logs
- As a user, I want to be able to view my peak and trough energy times
- As a user, I want to be able to visualize patterns in my energy levels through graphing my energy levels by time of day
